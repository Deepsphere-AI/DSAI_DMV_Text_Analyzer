  The black bear page says the British Army use black bear pelts for the bearskin hats of the Royal Guard, and certainly lots of other websites (PETA's, for example) suggest the black bear is used. However, the Wikipedia page on the bearskin hats states quite clearly that the hat is """"made from the fur of the Canadian brown bear and is dyed black. This is because the brown bear has thicker fuller fur"""". The brown bear being a different species from the black bear with its own Wikipedia page. I am wondering if anyone can clarify exactly which species is used to make the hats and give a reliable citation for that? On the bearskins page, one of the citations given for the use of brown-bear fur links to an article in the Independent that says black bears are used. So I am confused. 
 
  
 
  Umm on the habitat the first thing about forests should be: """"They prefer forested areas with low lying vegitation and shrubs, with thick brush"""" or something 
  Andrew Lilly 
 
  
  There was a conflict of data within the page about the weight of new born cubs. I have resolved it from Animal Diversity Web, which is usually reliable on such matters. 
 
  
  Sorry if this is the wrong place, but """"Females typically weight about 40 kg"""" this doesn't sound right to me. 
  :yes, it does sound a bit low, but it agrees with data from the US Fish and Wildlife service page in the External Links list 
  ::I just looked there, and it says """"from 125 to 400"""" pounds, not specifically mentioning females. 40 kg would be about 85 pounds only. The us forest service external link says """"females between 150 and 400 pounds"""". The bear center external link says: """"Wild females usually weigh between 90 and 300 pounds"""". So, none of the three external links is anywhere near saying """"Females typically weigh about 40 kg"""", note the """"typical"""" in there - it's not the minimum. My suspicion is, the number was doubly converted from pounds, so 200 pounds (which seems to be a typical weight for femals, from all 3 external links) -> 90 kg and then wrongly 90 pounds -> 40kg. 15 May 2005 
  :::Looked also on Animal Diversity Web, which says females weigh between 39 and 236 kg, and males between 47 and 409 kg, so modified the page accordingly. 
 
  Sorry, that one was my fault; I wrote a lot of this article. Unfortunately I am terrible at using the metric system. If there are any Canadians out there who see any inconsistencies please correct them, sadly Americans think in pounds ( 
 
  On an unrelated note, if anybody knows anything about the black bear in Mexico, please, write something. (Si hay alguien que sabe algo sobre el oso negro norteamericano, por favor, escriba algo en este articulo.) 
 
  
  As far as bear encounters go. After hundreds of bear encounters in the Canadian Rockies, I'm a bit leery of the advice given. 
  """"While yes - you can indeed scare a black bear off quite easily IN SOME CASES. I have found it is best to treat all bears no differently than you would a stray german sheppard, or pit bull roaming your neighborhood. Regardless of any situation they are indeed unpredictable. 
 
  The rule I have adhered to (although thankfully never having to practice it fully), after the above rule (basically giving them their space), is when you actually are under attack: 
 
  a. if the bear has cubs - play dead! Regardless of species, if it has cubs it's primary concern is likely for the cubs - period! Once it realizes you are not a threat, it will likely leave the area with it's cubs. 
 
  b. if it's a grizzly, play dead - you have zero chance of fighting a grizzly off regardless of the situation, so put your head between your legs and hope for the best (or kiss yer a$$ good-bye!). 
 
  c. if it's a black bear (no cubs) fight for your life to your last breath. Most black bears run about the same weight as a healthy large human male (and often less). You may prove too much of a challenge for the bear and it will leave. DO NOT scream and yell until you are under attack. Sometimes noise can be a trigger for bears to attack. 
 
  (for some reason or another they particularly seem to dislike the """"clickity click"""" of cameras...go figure. 
 
  
 
  """"If you play dead grizzlies may leave you alone but black bears will begin to eat you or drag you away"""" 
  This is entirely untrue. In fact, its the opposite situation. Black bears will think you are dead, 
  and grizzlies will definitly eat you. Generally speaking, the bear encounters in the wild should

  :*They exclude the All-Star Game, which nearly all fans would expect to be included 
  :*They exclude the World Series. This would astonish most people. 
  :*They exclude all play since 1994 until at least 2010. Since interleague play during the regular season began in 1997, the theorem is safe. Most people would see this as a crock.

  Hi LouisPhilippeCharles, I think I understand why you made the move that you did, but I suspect it will be disputed. Please, let's not rename the page again until we reach a consensus. Apparently the most common name is simply HÃ´tel de CondÃ©, but since there is already an article with that title which is about a different complex of buildings in a different location, which existed prior to this building, we need to distinguish the title of this article from that one by some means. In such cases, it is common to add a parenthetical differentiator to the title. I therefore suggest, as a compromise, that we use the title """"HÃ´tel de CondÃ© (rue Monsieur)"""". The current title """"HÃ´tel de Mademoiselle de CondÃ©"""" may be less than ideal, because it is not a very common name for the site, and we have only one reference that appears to support it.

  This is going to take a while to accomplish. I suggest we come up with some type of rough outline to follow. 
  :Can an administrator clarify what is being merged? Just the Oxfordian articles listed at the top? All the authorship articles (Baconian, Marlovian, Oxfordian, etc)? All of these into the Authorship article? Both Oxfordian articles into one? So many options were listed in the discussion that I am not sure what has been decided. An administrator needs to clarify this before we can move forward. 
  ::Once we get clarification, I also think it's been made clear that primary anti-Stratfordian texts cannot be used, or at least that's my understanding. This will take a bit longer to set up than just rushing in there with a machete, not that I think anybody is advising such. Meanwhile, I've got one short project left to finish before I can answer your charges against me, so look for my answers sometime tomorrow. I'll probably also answer them in stages, since there are so many of them. 
  ::Start with a summary style main article written in Talk:Shakespeare authorship question/sandbox. All editors should work to provide a full and detailed accounting of the controversy keeping in mind WP:NPOV, WP:V, WP:RS, and WP:FRINGE. After the article is written, then replace this article and redirect all the other articles unless a clear rationale for a content fork or spinout article is shown to exist while creating that article. As for primary source documents, please keep in mind WP:PSTS. 
  :::It is not at all clear that primary anti-Stratfordian texts cannot be used. WP:PSTS asserts that primary sources may be used, but only with care. And that caveat does not merely apply to anti-Stratfordian texts, it applies to all primary sources, Stratfordian or otherwise. 
  :::::Using primary-source anti-Stratfordian references with care is appropriate. Please try to find external, independent, secondary and tertiary sources to keep the article as neutral as possible. 
  ::::It appears we have an issue with the decision to merge. I opened up a discussion with Wiki founder Jimbo Wales who advised this: 
 
  ::::""""For what it is worth, I misread the close. What I meant is that there seems to be a consensus against undertaking a merge. I see that the close says the opposite, perhaps Peter just mistyped? It happens. ) Jimbo Wales (talk) """" 
 
  ::::I will check with Peter to see if he agrees, otherwise, we will need to followup on this discrepancy. 
 
  :::::The """"close"""" I wrote above makes it clear that merging is preferred following the Wikipedia:Content fork guidelines. Developing the article in Talk:Shakespeare authorship question/sandbox is preferred to continuing forum shopping. Thanks. 
 
  My understanding is that the decision was based on the conclusion that the """"arguments for consolidating articles on alternative authorship hypotheses are stronger than those arguments for keeping them separate,"""" not a straight majority vote. 
 
  It appears that consensus=majority when Smatprt wins the raw vote, but I bet I can find at least five instances in the past two months where I was told that consensusâ‰ majority when the majority was against him 
 
  :To clarify: this is not to say that at the end of the day there will be only one article. This is only to say that we should proceed from the ideals of Wikipedia:Summary style and move forward. The sandbox is open, and I encourage people to begin to write. The best arguments on the side of those opposing the merge are those who say that we may run into WP:WEIGHT issues with extreme minority authorship opinions getting full paragraphs that compare in size to, say, the Oxfordians. Well, that's what the sandbox is for: to get the weighting right before going live. It may be that some of the tiniest minorit",0.13052343,0.032171372,0.0,0.0,0.07460359,0.0
